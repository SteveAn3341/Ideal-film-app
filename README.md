About:
IdealFilmFinder is an app designed to help users discover their favorite movies, dramas, and animations. Upon logging in, users can choose a category, and the app will present two random options within that category. Users must select the one they prefer, and the process continues. As users make their selections, the app narrows down their preferences and ultimately reveals their top choices in the chosen category.

In addition to personalizing the experience for individual users, IdealFilmFinder tracks the most popular choices across all users. This aggregated data is displayed on the app, allowing users to see which films, dramas, and animations are favored by the community. Through this interactive and engaging process, IdealFilmFinder makes discovering new entertainment enjoyable and effortless.
